# DKC4

A Donkey Kong Country 2 remake in the Unity Engine.
This repository is for learning purposes only.

## Current Progress

It's still in development, you can check my (bad) TODO list [here](./TODO.md).

## Motivation

I am a web application developer and always wanted to learn making games using Unity, but creating a game depends on art and sound design, coding, mechanics and game design. I suck at art and sound, so I decided to skip this learning step using content from one of my favorite game.

## Goal

The idea is to learn as much as possible about the game development workflow using Unity.
For now I want to keep it secret, but this is not a 1:1 recreation of a existing level, and no "new content" will be added.
I want to make a short but interesting experience, pushing boundaries that wouldn't be possible on SNES.

## Thanks

I am grateful [Sprite Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/), dedicated to the collection, archival, and appreciation of materials from video games.
Also thanks to [DKC Wiki](https://donkeykong.fandom.com/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Wiki) for all the detailed information stored, and [DKC Atlas](http://www.dkc-atlas.com/) which I used to visualized and study the game levels.
